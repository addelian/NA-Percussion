		<p>This website is currently a proof of concept while I continue to build out projects and ideas as a developer. It is not a finished product yet!<br></p>
		<p>Programming and web development interest me because I'm not just interested in the "whys" of the world -- I'm interested in the "hows."<br>
			I've been casually coding on and off since I was 10 years old, but decided to pursue it full-force beginning in 2019. I'm continuing to<br>
			build my skill set in both front- and back-end languages, and love discovering new ways in which I can implement my code.<br>
			I've begun to fall in love with coding because it resonates with me as a musician. I've discovered so many parallels between the two discliplines:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>The learning <em>never stops.</em> Every day is a loop of applying what I know, discovering something new, and building it into my vocabulary.</li>
				<li>The variety of languages and applications for them are endless, much like the variety of musical genres in the world. I can share the stage with<br>
					two of the exact same sets of musicians but play extremely different music in a symphony orchestra versus a jazz band, for example. In that same<br>
					vein, two people with the job title "programmer" are almost certainly following entirely different career paths, using entirely different languages.</li>
				<li>The programming community that I've discovered thus far into my journey has been supportive and endlessly helpful. Coding is about collaboration and<br>
					creating something greater than any of us could do as individuals. Music works exactly the same way. We collaborate so that we grow beyond ourselves!</li>
				<li>Programming and music both make use of the left and right brain. They both involve a constant mental loop of figuring out how best to implement an idea<br> 
					efficiently or cleanly, and appealing to the senses while doing so.
				</li>
			</ul>

		Thank you for your interest in my website. Please check back often as I continue to update it with multimedia and coding projects of mine.
