		<p>This calculator is based loosely off of a tip calculator, with modified calculations to fit the indicated inputs.<br></p>

			<p>As a jazz drummer, I am often approached about performances ("gigs") with very little advance notice. As I accepted more gigs around the area,<br>
			I realized that I was beginning to lose track of how much money I was actually making (or had the potential to make) at each gig. To help facili-<br>
			tate a well-informed decision in pursuing a gig or not, I began logging the venue locations and average payout of each performance and used that<br>
			information to build this calculator.</p>
			
			<p>The premise of the calculator is to determine how much I might expect to make at a local venue if I were to accept a gig, assuming I knew a little<br>
			bit of background information about the gig ahead of time (namely, the weekday of the performance, how many people with which I am playing, and how<br>
			much money in tips I ancitipate the group to receive).</p>
			
			<p>The calculator accepts three different inputs - "Venue," "Tip amount," and "Number of People." Tip amount is entirely optional (assumed zero if no<br>
			input), and number of people defaults to "one" if no input is given. The Venue is a dropdown of multiple locations along with the relevant weekday,<br>
			which sometimes affects payment at local jazz gigs (especially at the Des Moines jazz club Noce).</p>
			
			<p>Certain elements of the calculator do not display until the projected payment is actually calculated, and the only way to "break" the calculator<br>
			is to put in words instead of numbers. This only "breaks" it so much as it returns "$NaN" instead of a number, and as soon as the fields are updated<br>
			with numerical values, the calculator works again.</p>
